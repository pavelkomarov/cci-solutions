# cci-solutions
My solutions to exercises in Cracking the Coding Interview, in Python.

I've named files like `cci_##.py`, where `##` is a chapter number. All answers for a chapter are written in a single file, with little `assert`s to test each one right after its implementation. Simply run the file to check all these tests.

Some helpful utilities I've had to build and use along the way:
- `from cci_02 import Node` for linked lists
- `from cci_04 import TreeNode` for binary trees
- `from cci_10 import BitVector` for a bit map
- This [`pytest` example](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/projection-pursuit/blob/master/skpp/tests/test_skpp.py) demonstrates a complementary approach to chapter 11, which is focused much more on the high-level.
- `cci_14.py` for examples of how to use `sqlite3`
- `cci_15.py` for examples of how to use `threading`

Note that when importing all the code in the corresponding file gets run, because I haven't been careful enough to put things in `if __name__ == '__main__':` blocks.
