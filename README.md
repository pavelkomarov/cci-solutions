# cci-solutions
My solutions to exercises in Cracking the Coding Interview, in Python.

I've named files like `cci_#.py`, where `#` is a chapter number. All answers are written in a single file, with little `assert`s to test each one right after its implementation. Simply run the file to check all these tests.

Some helpful utility classes I've had to build along the way:
- `from cci_2 import Node` for linked lists
- `from cci_4 import TreeNode` for binary trees

Chapter names:
1. Arrays and Strings
2. Linked Lists
3. Stacks and Queues
4. Trees and Graphs
5. Bit Manipulation
