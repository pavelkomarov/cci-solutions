# I'm not gonna run a whole simulation. The point is just to make some sensible classes with

# Three
# Let's say it's meant to represent a physical jukebox that plays records and takes dollars
# We'll need Record and Money classes, We'll probably need to represent a Record as having a
# couple Songs. Songs are organized by Genre, Artist, year, etc. We might want objects or at
# least enums for many of these. The overall Jukebox will need to be able to search songs by
# features, take payment, maybe play randomly if no one is making a selection. It will need to
# have a way to communicate information out to users. If we want to get really fancy, users
# might have Accounts linked to particular Favorites or Playlists, and we'd need a way to take
# the requisite information to build those. The Jukebox has a Stage (or something) where the
# currently-playing piece of physical media is located. Other media can't be played until it's
# swapped out to be the staged thing.

# Four
# We'll have Spaces, which can be normal or handicapped, superwide or normal or compact, and
# can be full or empty. We might arrange them in to lettered/numbered rows/cols in some cases,
# but not in others. The ParkingLot collects a bunch of Spaces together and might keep track of
# how long cars have been in the lot. If it's paid parking, there might be some form of Ticket
# that parkers generate and put on their dash, and the ParkingLot will know about these and keep
# track of their countdowns if appropriate. We might be able to ask the ParkingLot how many free
# Spaces there are in given rows or levels. If we're really futuristic, then maybe the
# ParkingLot parks Cars all by itself! There might be several types of vehicle, which fit in
# different types of Spaces.

# Five
# We'll need Books, of course. Likely Accounts for users, so we know who has access to which
# Books. We'll need BookMarks for each user associated with their Books, so we can keep their
# places for them. We might want Annotations or Highlights likewise associated betwen Account
# and Book. Accounts might have payment information, like a CreditCard. Books will have scrolling
# and page flip functions. The books will be kept in a Library, which is searchable by Author,
# Genre, year, etc. Accounts can be kept in a list or dictionary, but if managing that gets too
# involved, we might consider a Manager class. On the frontend, the Display itself may have
# Buttons and a View, which get attached to actions (likely JavaScript).

# a conversation with you if we're not already contacts, but I prefer the raw model, like Reddit.
