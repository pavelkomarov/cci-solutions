# I'd do a merge sort on the lines. First just take little chunks of 5 lines or so and sort them,
# then merge, merge, merge, merge up to the full 20 GB. We used to do this for alphabetizing graded
# tests when I was a CS TA. You'd need auxiliary space for this, not a ton if you delete info from
# the original file as you copy and mergesort it elsewhere. You couldn't really do a quicksort so
# easily, because lines might have different lengths, so swapping them around each other would
# result in overlaps unless you shift *everything* in between, which is gross.

# Seven
# The way to do this if you have tons of memory is to just create a gigantic bit vector to keep track
# of what has been seen. Iterate back through looking for an unset bit, and there's your missing
# number. An alternative if you have limited memory is to do this over smaller ranges, but if we have
# 2^31 possible nonnegative ints and only a little over 2^26 bits in 10 MB, then we might have to do
# 32 passes in order to find what's missing. At that point, may as well sort the numbers and look for
# a gap, because log(1 billion) is like 29, which is < 32. A clever alternative from the solutions is
# to establish ranges of numbers and iterate through the array counting how many fall on each range.
# Since numbers must be unique, we can tell that a range that hasn't completely filled must have
# something missing. Then we can go back and make a bit vector just for that range, iterate the big
# array again, tossing things outside the range, setting bits within, then iterate the bit vector
# looking for a 0 just like before.
