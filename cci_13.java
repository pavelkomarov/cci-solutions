/** One
 * Making a constructor private means *only* that class itself (and any inner classes) can instantiate it. So
 * if you want to use the class, you can't call it's constructor; you'll instead have to call some other public
 * method that the author has exposed, which then gets to govern all object creation. Or you'll have to use
 * one of the inner classes. Either way, the point is that the author gets complete control over how the class 
 * is instantiated. According to the internet, you might want to use this if you're pursuing a Singleton pattern.
 * I think Singletons are stupid, so this is overall a somewhat goofy language feature you probably don't need.

// Running the above with `java Two` prints "finally" then the 0. So yes, it appears the finally block is called
// even in the case of early return. The solutions say it's possible a finally isn't executed if the thread is
// killed externally or the JVM dies. But I wouldn't expect recovery to be possible under those conditions, so
// it's like "The finally always executes unless a bomb drops on your program."

/** Three
 * `final` is a keyword that makes a variable unmodifyable or locks a pointer to point to whatever it's currently
 * pointing to. Apparently it can also be used with methods to make them un-overrideable or to classes to make
 * them un-subclassable.
 * `finally` is a block associated with try-catch blocks
 * According to the internet, `finalize()` is a method called by the garbage collector when no more references to
 * an object remain. You can override it if you want special deletion behavior, but I've always just used
 * java.lang.Object's default.

/** Four
 * Templates and generics are similar, but how they work differs: Container<Type> in Java can work with any
 * particular Type, and effectively what happens is the compiler knows to do a bunch of casting to ensure that
 * things coming out of Container are marked as the right Type. Whereas in C++ Container<Type> ends up compiled
 * to something completely different for each specifc Type. So in Java, the type of Container<String> and
 * Container<Person> is the same, whereas they are different in C++. This has some consequences around static
 * variables: A Container<String> and Container<Person> will share the same static variables in Java, but not so
 * in C++. It's also the case that Java requires the Type to be an object, so you have to use Integer instead of
 * the primative int, for example, whereas C++ doesn't care. In Java you can restrict your generic to only work
 * with certain types (<T extends U>, meaning T is U or a subclass of U or an implementor of U), but in C++ you
 * can't restrict, which could lead to danger if you try to use a template with a class that doesn't have features
 * it expects.

/** Five
 * They're all maps with the same interface. They only differ in how they're implemented. A HashMap is typically
 * an array of linked lists, offering amortized O(1) lookup and retrieval time. A TreeMap stores things in a BST.
 * The hints say it's a red-black tree in Java, which is self-balancing and offers amortized O(log n) lookup time.
 * According to the internet, a LinkedHashMap is like an ordinary HashMap, except it maintains a doubly-linked
 * list through all its elements, so that you can iterate them in the order they were added. Double linkages
 * ensure things can be removed in O(1). An interesting feature of the TreeMap is that you can iterate the keys
 * in order (alphabetical, or whatever comparitor you like) by performing a tree traversal. So if you need
 * particular ordering, you might want to use one of these alernatives to the HashMap.

/** Six
 * Reflection is a bunch of properties and methods that allow you to see the class, methods, fields, etc. of an
 * object and get, set, invoke, etc. them programmatically by name or reference. Some times you want to be able to
 * interrogate and call this information, for example I used reflection heavily when writing my scikit-learn model
 * params -> xml function.
