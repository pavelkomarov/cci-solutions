# One
# A thread shares the same resources as other threads. Processes don't share resources. A process
# can have many threads, but a thread can belong to only one process. It's convenient to use
# parallel processes if you have a job that can be truly split, which doesn't require sharing of
# any kind, because you don't have to worry about processes interfering. You'd want to make that
# complexity tradeoff and risk threads stepping on each other if you truly do need them to share
# information, because sharing a memory space is a far faster way to share than to write to/read
# from disk or pipe information between processes (by copying it from one's memory space to
# anothers').

# Two
# In order for context to switch, the system has to save the state of the current process and
# restore the saved state of some other process. We really want to know when one process ends and
# another begins. We need processes to log this informtion somehow. But if we have processes write
# this info to disk, then since the timescale of doing so is so large, we could throw the length
# of our measurement significantly, rendering it useless. I'm not sure whether there's so much of
# a delay to print things to a terminal, or to a particular memory location. We'd incur some
# slowdown by doing that extra work, but it's on the scale of work we're doing already, so it
# won't introduce a ton of error. The solutions rightly point out that there will be a lot of
# extraneous stuff going on on a computer, so it's possible that we're interrupted by any number
# of things. I like the suggestion of ping-ponging a piece of data back and forth between processes.
# They'll each have to suspend and wait for the other to be context-switched to, and revived to
# respond. We can also get many time-points from this, which should give us a more reliable
# statistic. The scheduler, which is a bit of OS black magic beyond our direct control, will also
# be encouraged to prioritize the correct next process. The solutions point out another wrinkle:
# sending and recieving will take time, but we can figure out how much by sending and recieving a
# bit of data to the same process over the pipe or network and then subtract it out.

# Python's threads don't really work in parallel, but for purposes of these questions, I think
# they're sufficient to implement the spirit of the answer.

# method As in parallel, because synchronization is instance-specific. If B is not synchronized, then
# sure, the two methods can execute in parallel. If B were synchronized, it uses the same lock as A
# within the instance, so they couldn't execute in parallel.
