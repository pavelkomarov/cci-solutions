	# take two of these and add them, then the pdf looks like the convolution:
	# [0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16, 0.2 , 0.16, 0.12, 0.08, 0.04]. This has sort of a triangular
	# shape (classic convolve two boxes), and if we keep convolving with that pdf (adding more
	# RVs), then we end up with a gaussian. Interestingly, if we do this long enough and then
	# "wrap" the distribution around some number, then we end up with a uniform distribution
	# however long we want.
	def wrap(pdf, mod): # I used a similar function to help me visualize what
		r = [0]*mod		# mod does to a probability distribution.
		for i,p in pdf:
			r[i % mod] += p
		return r
	# But this requires many many RVs, and so many calls to rand5(), and it's still not exact,
	# because 7 and 5 are prime, so 5*k can't be split in to 7 buckets evenly. I spent a while
	# trying to wrap and convolve various wrapings and convolutions of the pdf and its derivatives,
	# but I couldn't manage to get back a distribution with seven evenly-weighted entries.
	#
	# Here's a clever alternative: Consider two rand5() results to be digits in a base 5 number.
	# We can construct our number in base 10 as 5*rand5() + rand5(). Why does this work? Well,
	# that first term is basically spacing out the probability spikes. Now instead of deltas at
	# 0,1,2,3,4, we get them at 0,5,10,15,20. If we convolve our old [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
	# with this new [0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2]
	# then we get [0.04]*25. That's more than enough evenly-weighted things. If we were to take
	# the mod of this, "wrapping" it, then we can get a shorter distribution. For instance,
	# wrapping around 8, we get [0.16, 0.12, 0.12, 0.12, 0.12, 0.12, 0.12, 0.12]. So basically if
	# our number % 8 == 0, toss it, and if it's in [1,7], return that-1.
	#
	# Notice that 0,8,16,24 are the entries causing % 8 == 0, which leaves 25 - 4 = 21 entries
	# from our original distribution. 21 is evenly divisible by 7, which is why we can assign
	# an equal number of each of those possibilities to each bucket of rand7(). What do we do
	# if % 8 == 0? We'll have to resample two rand5()s to generate a different number. The odds
	# we have to do this are 4/25. So the pdf of the number of times we have to draw is f(k) =
	# (4/25)^(k-1)*(1 - 4/25), and sum k = 1 to infinity f(k) = 1. E(X) = Σ x P(X = x) ->
	# sum k = 1 to infinity k * f(k) = 1.1905, so this converges really quickly, and we expect
	# to have draw only a little over once on average.
	#
	# We could shrink that expected value sum if we chose 3, 4, or more digits of a number to
	# start. For 3, we have 125 % 7 = 6, and substituting in this probability we get 1.0504
	# draws on average. For 4, we have 5^4 % 7 = 2, and we have to draw 1.0032 times on average.
	# But these are more expensive draws, involving more calls to rand5(). 3*1.0504 and 4*1.0032
