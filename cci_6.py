# the next day, so it's day 3 the third person realizes the third has got to be them and they leave.

# classic egg drop. The unfortunate thing about this problem is it's always phrased as "You have
# N floors and d drops" or "You have N floors and k eggs" "How many eggs/drops does it take in
# the worst case to find f, the first floor where the egg breaks/last one where it doesn't?",
# which is just confusing. Really, it's better to think of N as the output and k,d as the input:
# "How many floors can I guarantee I cover with k eggs and d drops?"
#
# If I have 0 eggs or 0 drops, then I can cover no floors, so that's our base case. If I drop and
# it breaks, I still need to find the last floor where an egg doesn't to be sure of where the
# cutoff lies. If the egg doesn't break, then I need to find the first one where it does to be sure
# of the cutoff. If the egg breaks, I've effectively covered everything above, because I know what
# will happen if I drop from higher. And if it doesn't, I cover everything below, because I know
# what will happen if I drop from lower. So I've either got k-1 or k eggs, and I have d-1 drops,
# and since the ranges I'll be searching in those two cases don't overlap, the number of floors
# I can cover at the dth drop is perfectly additive. One more wrinkle: By dropping at a floor, I
# cover that floor, so we get a +1 in the recurrence.

# Alternative math-based solution for exactly two eggs: We want to balance their drops so
# |egg1 drops| + |egg2 drops| = d. As egg1 survives more drops, egg2 should have 1 fewer floors to
# cover. Say egg1 breaks on the first drop from floor x, then egg2 will have to be dropped from 1
# up to x-1 in the worst case. 1 + x-1 = d -> x = d. So here |egg1 drops| = 1, and |egg2 drops| = d-1
# Say egg1 breaks on the second drop, then for our balance to hold, we'll want egg2 to only need to
# cover d-2 locations: d+1 (right above last egg1 drop) up to d+(d-2). This means we should drop egg1
# at d+(d-1). This ladder continues upward until our egg1 reaches 100:
# d + (d-1) + (d-2) + (d-3) ... 2 + 1 = 100. We can sum up the left side with Euler's trick:
# d*(d+1)//2 = 100, and if we take the ceiling of the solution, we get d = 14.
